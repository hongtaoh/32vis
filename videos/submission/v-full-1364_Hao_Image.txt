Fields of study at different levels in 3,240 VIS papers across the past 32 years. From L0 to L3, granularity increases. “Trend” indicates the proportion of papers falling into a field of study against the total number of papers published in that year. The highest proportion for each field of study is highlighted. “Total” indicates the total number of VIS publications falling into a field of study. One paper may contain more than one field of study at the same level, and one field of study may have multiple parent fields. For example, Pattern Recognition belongs to both Computer Science and Psychology.
